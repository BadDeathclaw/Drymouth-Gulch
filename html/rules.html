<p><strong>Ignorance is not a excuse, read the rules.</strong></p>
<p>0. The rules are the rules. Follow the spirit of the rules and use common sense, and you should have no problems.</p>
<p>0.1 Know your faction lore and IC specific rules. If you play as any aligned faction, consider the server rules, superior to Lore.</p>
<p>1. Don't be a dick. Play for fun, not to win.</p>
<p>2. Do not use information gained outside of in character means. No Meta.</p>
<p>3. Do not say in character (IC) things in the out of character (OOC) chat channel. Keep it IC.</p>
<p>4. The role you spawn in as is the role you should play, joining as a role to desert or otherwise not play it, gets you a jobban.</p>
<p>5. In-game administration rulings are final. If you have a problem with the ruling, take it to another member of staff. Fishing for admins is not recommended.</p>
<p>6. Faction Metagaming. Do not move to the enemy factions base until at least 40 minutes into the round. Claiming to have &lsquo;found it&rsquo; is a bad excuse, and isn&rsquo;t going to work.</p>
<p>7. Bad Deathclaw has a focus towards roleplay. Roleplay a believable character that could exist in the Fallout universe. Shitty memes and low roleplay gimmicks will not end well.</p>
<p>8. Do not be unnecessarily hostile. Arguments are fine, being an asshole for no reason isn't. This includes taking it to OOC chat and making trouble.</p>
<p>9. Do not attack or harm AFK/SSD players. You are free to take their items, but not attack them.</p>
<p>10. No rule lawyering.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>B. Approach, Motivation and Escalation</strong></p>
<p>1. Do not attack someone wordlessly.</p>
<p>2. Establish hostility before attacking. This means using your words. Wait for them to react, whether words, brandishing a weapon, violence, or compliance.</p>
<p>3. Escalation comes with reasoning and is mostly limited by role background. You shouldn&rsquo;t see Wastelanders and Settlers being mass-murderers, but Raiders are more likely.</p>
<p>4. Fleeing confrontation constitutes escalation.</p>
<p>5. If you suspect the other player is going to fail to escalate properly, it&rsquo;s better to let it pan out, then shoot first and have -you- look like the villain.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>C. General Conflict</strong></p>
<p>If a player wrongs you (theft, breaks into your shop, etc, you may retaliate in any way you see fit as long as it&rsquo;s appropriate according to your role.</p>
<p>You can rob, be robbed, defend yourself, murder or be murdered, as long as escalation is adhered to, and you have an IC Reason.</p>
<p>If a player tries to do this wordlessly and you&rsquo;re not able to catch them in the act or say something before they&rsquo;ve done it, try and get a screenshot or the like, otherwise it&rsquo;s a very hard situation to judge from an admin standpoint.</p>
<p>You may instigate conflict with another player within reasoning and motivation. You can't rob and rape a random victim while unprovoked as a Wastelander or Settler, but you could as a Raider, if you follow proper escalation.
    <br />Stay true to your chosen position and mindset, and always remember to escalate appropriately.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>C.1. NCR and Legion Conflict</strong></p>
<p>Given that approach rules are followed combat is allowed at any point;
    <br />And is expected to be initiated, the NCR and Legion are at war.</p>
<p>To engage with your enemy at every point isn't required but it is entirely within reason.</p>
<p>Retreating is fine if you can&rsquo;t win, but remember, actively avoiding escalation looks bad from the admins perspective.</p>
<p>Escalation rules apply.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>D. Alignment and Siding</strong></p>
<p>1.Wastelanders and raiders are allowed to join and side with any of the factions.</p>
<p>2. No hostile action is allowed to be taken while siding with a faction unless you are in their full uniform and attire. Unless you express your verbal allegiance during escalation, you will not be considered valid.</p>
<p>3. When you have joined a faction, you should wear as much of their uniform as is available, or verbally side with them, when situations are escalating.</p>
<p>4. All NCR/BOS/Legion Roles, are beholden to IC Rules, and in the case of their Leaders/Higher Ranks, OOC Rules.</p>
<p>5. Repeatedly breaking IC rules can result in admin intervention.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>E. Uniforms and Armor</strong></p>
<p>1. Faction uniforms are to be kept at all times unless deserting or infiltrating non-lethally.
    <br />(Expect consequences if you desert your respective faction!)</p>
<p>2. Faction armor should only be changed out of for the purposes of infiltration.</p>
<p>3. Faction uniforms can be used by anyone, but fall under these rules, and normal escalation rules. No surprise murders, no matter how much you like.</p>
<p>4. If dressed as a member of a faction, you are treated as one for matters of escalation and conflict.</p>
<p>5. When infiltrating, it is important to let staff know when you do so. It allows them to be aware of it before issues occur.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>F. Caesar&rsquo;s Legion Specific Rules</strong></p>
<p>Legion Chain of Command is as Follows.
    <br />-Caesar.
    <br />-Legate.
    <br />-Praetorian.
    <br />-Centurion.
    <br />-Veteran Decanus.
    <br />-Decanus.
    <br />-Veteran Legionary/Explorer.
    <br />-Recruit Legionary/Scout.
    <br />-Camp Follower.
    <br />Vexillarius has no real rank. They hold a flag and doot doot.</p>
<p>0. No female or ghoul legionnaires.</p>
<p>1. Stay within the Roman theme of naming. You&rsquo;d be given a new name when you join the Legion.</p>
<p>2. No medicine save for healing powder, poultice, bitter drink and mushrooms for anti-toxin. Chems must be disposed of.</p>
<p>3. The Legion uses any equipment it finds, but would not keep items like medical technology, or techno-magic items, such as bluespace backpacks.</p>
<p>4. Legion ranks are defined by equipment. Survivors traditionally reform the hierarchy by taking the armor of their dead superiors, to assume their position.</p>
<p>5. Caesar&rsquo;s Legion consider women inferior, this delegates them to support and slavery, rarely if ever do they accept a woman as worthy as more than a slave.</p>
<p>6. NCR are typically strung up on a cross when captured (and if it is deem fitting, they can be turned into slaves),as are chem users.</p>
<p>7. Men are to be trained as Legionaries, while women are to be trained as healers and farmers, as well as cooks.</p>
<p>8. Caesar's Legion is comprised of mainly tribals, meaning most of them do not know how to read, however the Centurions of war camps are typically somewhat educated.</p>
<p>9. Camp Followers are entirely loyal to the Legion. Playing them as anything but is grounds for a jobban. There are reasonable exceptions to this, such as overt abuse by the Legion, who should at least treat you as an asset.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>G. NCR Specific Rules</strong></p>
<p>0. The chain of command goes as;
    <br />General
    <br />Colonel
    <br />Major
    <br />Captain
    <br />Lieutenant
    <br />Sergeant
    <br />Trooper
    <br />Recruit</p>
<p>The NCR Rangers operate almost entirely outside of the normal NCR army.
    <br />They do not follow normal military ranks.
    <br />Rangers are working alongside the local forces, and should cooperate with the CO&rsquo;s wherever possible.</p>
<p>If there are no officers present, a Veteran Ranger may take command, but may not perform field punishments beyond brigging.</p>
<p>Ranger Detachment and its Ranks;
    <br />Veteran Ranger
    <br />Patrol Ranger
    <br />Scout Ranger
    <br />Ranger Recruit</p>
<p>1. Breaking the Chain of Command or deserting means you can be summarily executed by commanding officers.</p>
<p>2. No drinking, gambling, or fucking on Duty. The CO determines who is Off-Duty, traditionally when any major threats in the area are dealt with.</p>
<p>2.1 No Drugs, excluding Med-X for those in great pain. You can be executed for using recreational chems.</p>
<p>3. Rangers are beholden to their orders, the CO's, and common sense. They do not command unless no Sergeants/Lieutenants/Captains are present.</p>
<p>4. NCR should never cut deals with raiders and the such.</p>
<p>5. Sergeants controls the Armory, unless a superior officer takes control. You should not go into it and grab whatever equipment you like.</p>
<p>6. Prisoners should not be subject to torture or any harm when arrested. They may be executed under order of the CO.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>H. The Brotherhood of Steel Rules</strong>
    <br />Brotherhood Chain of Command varies, based on the personnel Present.
    <br />Paladin/Head Scribe.
    <br />Knight/Scribe.
    <br />Initiate Knight/Initiate Scribe.</p>
<p>0. This is the West Coast Chapter/Brotherhood, the East Chapter should only make an appearance through events.</p>
<p>1. The Brotherhood of Steel is held to a much higher standard than anything else on the server. As such as the rules are harder to follow, and the repercussions are more severe.</p>
<p>1.1 The Brotherhood have an established Chain of Command, known as the Chain That Binds. This system prevents Paladins from ordering around initiates assigned to a Scribe or Knight, unless no Scribes or Knights are responsive.</p>
<p>1.2 The Paladin is responsible for all operations relating to the Security of the Bunker, as well as any personnel entering or leaving.</p>
<p>1.3 The Head Scribe is responsible for the internal operations of the Bunker, relating to research, personnel management, and interior design, where security is not a concern.</p>
<p>1.4. When the chain that binds cannot be followed due to a lack of personnel, the Paladin retains general command.</p>
<p>2. The Brotherhood of Steel values advanced technology, and advanced technology only. They are not interested in toasters. They are interested in power armor and stockpiles of energy weapons.</p>
<p>3. The Brotherhood of Steel is an isolationist faction, and as such only trades for technology they cannot otherwise obtain, as well as vital resources to their survival.</p>
<p>5. The Brotherhood of Steel very rarely takes on new recruits, typically those who have proven themselves to the Brotherhood through some extraordinary manner.</p>
<p>6. They do not fiddle around with genetic tampering, diseases, and viruses. They may research it (i.e monkey), but not expose players to it or ever release it to the public.</p>
<p>7. No Ghouls are permitted within the ranks of the BoS.</p>
<p>8. The BoS does not engage in violence that is beyond what is necessary to achieve their goals. They are not violent conquerors, nor are they wasteland saviors. Direct aggressive behavior should be limited to acquiring dangerous/important technology, combating sworn enemies of the BoS (Particularly mutants, Enclave remnants), protecting themselves or their tech, or reacting to violent instigation from other factions/wastelanders.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>I. The Vault Rules</strong></p>
<p>0. The vault has no knowledge of the outside world, including if it is safe or not to open their doors.</p>
<p>1. The way they act depends on the Overseer and his directives. The Overseer is not comparable to the Captain in other servers; the Overseer wields much greater power and influence over his subjects, and his word is law. Overseer players must use their power wisely and not forget rule 1: Don't be a dick.</p>
<p>2. The Wasteland is a big scary place for the Vault Dwellers, so expect to roleplay as a character completely scared of the Wasteland and biased to the Vault as years of /Vault propaganda/ and listen to the Overseer. Dwellers shouldn&rsquo;t rebel, unless if something/certain someone (i.e Overseer and his decisions) threatens their precious lives.</p>
<p>3. Officers are supposed to keep the Dwellers safe, and only neutralize those that pose an actual threat. Those who don&rsquo;t and are convicted of minor crimes, are to head to the Brig to serve time.</p>
<p>4. Leaving the Vault is not allowed unless you have absolutely no other option.</p>
<p>5. No ghouls are allowed to spawn as a vault dweller.</p>
<p>Notes:
    <br />The vault may have an experiment chosen for it by the overseer, anything that is potentially rulebreaking should be brought to active staff to prevent needless repercussions.
    <br />Vault experiments may also be provided by Staff, at their leisure.</p>
<p>Wanting to leave the Vault for any other reason should be taken to admins for case by case judgement.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>J. Lowpop, Continuity and Cloning.</strong></p>
<p>1. Do not loot faction bases if there are no faction members there to defend said base. Ahelp if you are unsure if you are justified in raiding a faction base or not.</p>
<p>2. Don't name your character something obnoxious, nor do it over jokes. Raiders are exempt to this rule, and can name themselves almost anything that could exist in the Fallout universe. Do not make pop-culture jokes or Low Roleplay Jokes.</p>
<p>3. Never spawn the same character twice.
    <br />If you die, do not attempt to resume your prior life.
    <br />If you happen to spawn with a used name, contact admins immediately.</p>
<p>4. When cloned, the time you were scanned is the point you remember from. You will not recall who killed you, or even current information.
    <br />When cloned via pod-people means, you are functionally a new person, having only the personality and traits of the person recreated, without their memory.
    <br />Roleplay Appropriately!</p>
<p>5. Do not kill braindeads or AFK&rsquo;s. Looting is fair game, but don't kill them. When they are a member of your faction, shove them into a secure place at your base.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>K. Silicons</strong></p>
<p>Cyborgs and robots are held to a higher degree and violations result in direct jobban or tempban.</p>
<p>0. Know and follow your laws by the letter.
    <br />No excuses given, you are given abnormal powers, trust and access, to break your laws is to eat a ban.</p>
<p>1. Eyebots/Cyborgs are bound to their direct or indirect creator.
    <br />If they lack a creator they are meaningless and are allowed to roam the waste but not take part in it.
    <br />If they were created in a base, Vault, Enclave, NCR, and so on, they are bound to their faction and like so must care for and repair their compound and crew.</p>
<p>1.1 Eyebots aren't allowed to take part in fights.
    <br />Bots who are attacked can still defend themselves but aren't allowed to pick up anything but handguns and other one handed weapons.</p>
<p>1.2 Do not abuse bots mob immunity.
    <br />Eyebots who enter, fight on, clean or loot neutral zones and dungeons will be considered to be breaking the rules and will eat a silicon ban.</p>
<p>2. Borgs are stuck to their law set unconditionally but follow any command structure that the laws apply to.</p>
<p>3. Borgs are players too, bound by the same laws of escalation. There are no exceptions.</p>
