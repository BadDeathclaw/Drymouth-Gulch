<p><strong>Ignorance is not a excuse, read the rules.</strong></p>
<p>0. Don’t be a dick. If you are intentionally ruining another players experience or going out of your way to negatively impact the round, you can be punished for it..</p>
<p>    
	<br /><strong>General Rules</strong></p>
<p>1. Admin rulings are final. If you wish to contest a ruling, please go to the discord. In each situation, an admin**'**s ruling is how the rules are to be treated in that given situation.</p>
<p>2. Don’t use OOC information IC. Don’t leak IC information to OOC.</p>
<p>3. Play as the role you spawn in as, joining as a role to desert or otherwise undermine your faction is bannable.</p>
<p>4. Bad Deathclaw is an RP server, and roleplay is expected. Failing to do so is punishable.</p>
<p>4. Do not attack, assault or harm SSD/AFK players. You may take their equipment, but dragging them off or murdering them is not okay. Catatonic players are free game.</p>
<p>5. No Rules Lawyering.</p>
<p>6. Name your character appropriately. Inappropriate names may result in a ban. Raider names may be ridiculous, but should not reference OOC memes or pop culture.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Escalation Rules</strong></p>
<p>1. Legion and NCR do not need to escalate on one another, in any way. They may attack each other for any reason at any time.</p>
<p>2. No other parties may enter into combat with Legion or NCR without being in recognisable faction uniform, of either Legion or NCR. Armor and helmet count appropriately.</p>
<p>3. Legion and NCR must still escalate on any other party, in every situation.</p>
<p>4. Escalation requires a motive, as well as verbal interaction to establish hostile intent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Escalation requires a reaction from the party being escalated on. This reaction can be drawing their own weapon, running away, popping pre-combat meds and so forth.</p>
<p>If someone is attempting to negotiate or is complying with your demands, you should not assault them for trying to negotiate, but instead interact with them. If their case is bad, you may still kill them.</p>
<p>If someone has used the Surrender Emote, you should not harm them unless they subsequently attempt to flee or attack you.</p>
<p>If you are caught in the crossfire of a fight, that is not an excuse to join either sides conflict. You should get out of the way. </p>
<p>You may still enter into conflict with non-faction groups, but should escalate clearly and openly, and wait at least 5 seconds before attempting any hostile actions. We can tell if you don’t.</p>
<p>Escalation requires a reaction from the party being escalated on. This reaction can be drawing their own weapon, running away, popping pre-combat meds and so forth.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Examples of Escalation</strong></p>
<p>• Aggressor is a raider (Motivation: Raiding and stealing, etc) and tells the victim to get on the ground. Victim draws their own gun. Situation is fully escalated and combat may ensue.</p>
<p>• Aggressor is a raider (Motivation: Raiding and stealing, etc) and tells the victim to get on the ground. Victim replies “Please don’t hurt me” and lays on the ground. The raider now has full control over the victim and may do whatever they please with them, however killing them on the spot without further roleplay will warrant a bwoink.</p>
<p>• Aggressor is NCR (Motivation: To deal with a raider gang.) and tells them to surrender or die. Some of the Raiders Surrender, but the rest are gunned down. The NCR then detains the raiders that surrendered.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>General Conflict</strong></p>
<p>1. Settlers and Wastelanders should not be starting fights and trying to rob people.</p>
<p>2. Settlers and Wastelanders may react to theft and other petty crimes appropriately, which in the Wasteland means shooting them.</p>
<p>3. Raiders may escalate for motivations such as theft, or being tasked with killing someone.</p>
<p>4. Mercenaries may escalate for the purposes of killing targets, or defending someone.</p>
<p>Eg: Your house is being broken into, and you shoot the person breaking in. Someone steals a locker from you as you travel.</p>
<p>Eg: If someone is running from you and not letting you escalate, you can fire upon them as this is fleeing conflict. Be mindful as they may not have noticed, so point at them aggressively.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Uniform and Siding</strong></p>
<p>1. Faction uniforms are to be kept at all times unless deserting or infiltrating. (Expect consequences if you desert your respective faction!)</p>
<p>2. To participate in a faction raid/conflict, you MUST be in that factions uniform, or be clearly identifiable through the use of the Faction Tabard item.</p>
<p>3. Faction uniforms can be used by anyone, but fall under these rules, and normal escalation rules. You cannot blast someone in the same faction you’re dressed as with no escalation.</p>
<p>4. You can freely align with either faction, but have to wear appropriate equipment.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Factions</strong></p>
<p>1. Faction Rules, though Primarily IC, may be punished OOCly.</p>
<p>2. They are primarily enforced through IC punishment by the factions higher ranks.</p>
<p>3. Do not raid a faction base before 60 minutes has passed.</p>
<p>4. Do not raid a faction base if it is undefended.</p>

    <br /><strong>H. The Brotherhood of Steel Rules</strong>
    <br />Brotherhood Chain of Command varies, based on the personnel Present.
    <br />Paladin
	<br />Head Scribe
    <br />Knight/Scribe
    <br />Initiate Knight/Initiate Scribe</p>
<p>0. This is the West Coast Chapter/Brotherhood, act accordingly based on the Western Chapter’s Lore.</p>
<p>1. The Brotherhood of Steel is held to a much higher standard than anything else on the server. As such as the rules are harder to follow, and the repercussions are more severe.</p>
<p>2. The Brotherhood have an established Chain of Command, known as the Chain That Binds. This system prevents Paladins from ordering around initiates assigned to a Scribe or Knight, unless no Scribes or Knights are responsive.</p>
<p>3. The Paladin is responsible for all operations relating to the security of the Bunker, as well as any personnel entering or leaving.</p>
<p>4. The Head Scribe is responsible for the internal operations of the Bunker, relating to research, personnel management, and interior design, where security is not a concern.</p>
<p>5. When the Chain that Binds cannot be followed due to a lack of personnel, the Paladin retains general command.</p>
<p>6. The Brotherhood of Steel values advanced technology, and advanced technology only. They are not interested in toasters. They are interested in power armor and stockpiles of energy weapons.</p>
<p>7. The Brotherhood of Steel is an isolationist faction, and as such only trades for technology they cannot otherwise obtain, as well as vital resources to their survival.</p>
<p>8. The Brotherhood of Steel very rarely takes on new recruits, typically those who have proven themselves to the Brotherhood through some extraordinary manner.</p>
<p>9. They do not fiddle around with genetic tampering, diseases, and viruses. They may research it (i.e monkey), but not expose players to it or ever release it to the public.</p>
<p>10. No Ghouls are permitted within the ranks of the BoS.</p>
<p>11. The BoS does not engage in violence that is beyond what is necessary to achieve their goals. They are not violent conquerors, nor are they wasteland saviors. Direct aggressive behavior should be limited to acquiring dangerous/important technology, combating sworn enemies of the BoS (Particularly mutants, Enclave remnants), protecting themselves or their tech, or reacting to violent instigation from other factions/wastelanders.</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>K. Silicons</strong></p>
<p>1. Know and follow your laws by the letter. No excuses given, you are given abnormal powers, trust and access, to break your laws is to eat a ban. </p>
<p>2.  Cyborgs are bound to their direct or indirect creator.
	<br />2.A - If they lack a creator they are meaningless and are allowed to roam the waste but not take part in it.
	<br />2.B - If they were created in a base, Vault, Enclave, NCR, and so on, they are bound to their faction and so must care for and repair their compound and crew.</p>
<p>3. Borgs are stuck to their law set unconditionally but follow any command structure that the laws apply to.</p>
<p>4. Borgs are players too, bound by the same laws of escalation. There are no exceptions.</p>
