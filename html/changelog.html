			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Legion Prime Armor and Helmets, for the Decanus variant as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some armor values are adjusted compared to live numbers but this was due to my early stages of the rework and my intent to buff Veteran armors and nerf some others, Ghost will fix the values as needed to bring them up to speed with the armor rework.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Prime Legionaries, has the loadout of the current Veteran Legionaries with a different look and different quality armor. Play time requirement of 3 hours with a cap of 8, essentially the equivalent of NCR troopers for Legion. Prime Legionaries spawn in the barracks/bunk room.</li>

Play time requirement of 22 hours and cap of 1. Prime Decanus spawns in the barracks/bunk room with their men.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a Playtime requirement of three hours to NCR trooper.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Replaces Captain's M1911 with a Deagle and 3 mags, also removes the Captain's Service Rifle.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased playtime requirement of Sheriff from one hour to eight.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Legion descriptions are adjusted to reflect a more proper example of Legion command structure and to avoid any over stepping of boundaries by Legion members in regards to their rank.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Increased playtime requirement of NCR Captain from 25 hours to 30 hours.</li>

The Veteran Decanus will also spawn there. Recruit Decanus now spawns in the barracks/bunk room with the Recruit Legionaries.</li>
