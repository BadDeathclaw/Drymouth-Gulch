				<li class="rscadd">Legion Prime Armor and Helmets, for the Decanus variant as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some armor values are adjusted compared to live numbers but this was due to my early stages of the rework and my intent to buff Veteran armors and nerf some others, Ghost will fix the values as needed to bring them up to speed with the armor rework.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Increased playtime requirement of Sheriff from one hour to eight.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Legion descriptions are adjusted to reflect a more proper example of Legion command structure and to avoid any over stepping of boundaries by Legion members in regards to their rank.</li>
