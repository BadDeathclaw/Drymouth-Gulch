	info = pick("Arbitrarily divide the VAULT-DENIZENS into two groups by an EASILY RECOGNIZABLE PHYSICAL FEATURE. TELL one group that they are lesser. Slower, dumber, worse listeners, pick their noses, etcetra. Restrict their ability to use features and devices of the vault such as the water cooler or sinks and segregate them from the other group. Use security to enforce these rules. Obviously, ensure security and yourself are in the better group, even if it requires re-arranging security.<BR>Record results.","Select a Vault-Dweller who is GOOD AT ACTING. Select a TEST SUBJECT. Allow the ACTOR to know what the experiment is. Setup a situation in which you have the TEST SUBJECT perform QUESTIONS on the ACTOR while informing the TEST SUBJECT to 'torture' the actor when a question is answered incorrectly. Increase the 'severity' of the 'torture' with each wrong question. Do NOT injure the ACTOR. Determine how far the TEST SUBJECT will obey authority figures. USE PHRASES such as 'please continue' or 'this is for the good of science' to try to prod them into continuing.<BR>Record results.","Inform ALL BUT ONE Vault-Dweller of the experiment. The LAST dweller is the TEST SUBJECT. Put together a series of QUESTIONS that are ANSWERABLE. Get your HELPERS to all agree to get every answer WRONG in EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. Allow them to answer both BEFORE and AFTER the TEST SUBJECT.<BR>Record results.","This study explores minimal-notice relocation to limited facilities. Notify VAULT-DENIZENS to pack up their workstations within 5 MINUTES and report to the MINING ELEVATOR. All personnel must VACATE the upper level of the vault within this period of time. RECONSTRUCT a typical vault as best capable in the lower level. DO NOT return to the upper level for any reason.<BR>Record results.","The Overseer is to refer to themselves at all moments as a god. Attempt to coax the vault into forming a religion around yourself.<BR>Record results.")
